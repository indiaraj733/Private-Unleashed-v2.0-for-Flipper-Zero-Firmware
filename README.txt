Private Unleashed 2.0 Firmware Installation
===========================================
1. Assume you have any new firmware installed like Unleashed 084+
   - This is needed to have all databases like IR and NFC keys
2. Backup existing setting_user and keeloq_mfcodes from /ext/subghz/assets
   - These files are KeeLoq mfcodes (for protocols based on KeeLoq coding) and user settings like custom modulations, CC1101 presets and frequencies
   - On RogueMaster, the file is called setting_user.txt
3. Now drop the key.fz file with the key unlocking the firmware to the SD card root (/ext/)
   - Caution: the check for the key is at stage before USB qFlipper port init. If you skip thius step, you should manually detach the SD card, connect to PC and drop the file to SD card root there.
4. Finally, reboot to DFU on your Flipper Zero. Open up the Settings menu and choose Power, then press Reboot and select Firmware Upgrade. Agree to the message showed.
   - You could also just select .dfu file in normal mode using qFlipper, it will automatically reboot the FZ and flash the FW
5. For those who are in DFU now: choose "Install from file" and choose the .dfu file (skips step 5)
   - This step is skipped for users who didn't reboot to DFU manually and used qFlipper
6. The final step is putting the files from subghz_assets to SD Card/subghz/assets
   - This can be done from qFlipper if the FZ booted normally
